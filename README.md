# gcode-viewer

[on npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gcode-viewer)

This is a basic GCode viewer lib for js / ts.  
It is specifically built for [GoSlice](https://github.com/aligator/GoSlice) but may also work with GCode from other slicers.
In contrast to other GCode viewers this one renders the lines using a mesh instead of lines. This is done because 
several browser-OS combination do not support line thickness rendering other than '1'.

## Features

* slicing the viewed lines either by layer or line by line
* line thickness based on the extrusion amount
* colorize the lines based on line-metadata such as temperature or speed
* changeable amount of radial segments per line - less (e.g. 3) is faster and needs less RAM, more (e.g. 8 -> the default) may look better.
* uses orbit controls from three js
* relative movement for xyz and extrusion (not tested yet)

## Usage
### Examples
[Take a look at this example.](example/index.html)  
[Also take a look here.](https://github.com/aligator/dev/blob/main/src/windows/gCodeViewer.tsx)

### Setup

```js
import { GCodeRenderer, Color, SpeedColorizer } from "gcode-viewer"

const renderer = new GCodeRenderer(gcodeString, 800, 600, new Color(0x808080))

// This is an example using the Speed colorizer.
// Other options are:
// * SimpleColorizer (default) - sets all lines to the same color
// * SpeedColorizer - colorizes based on the speed / feed rate
// * TempColorizer - colorizes based on the temperature
renderer.colorizer = new SpeedColorizer(this.renderer.getMinMaxValues().minSpeed || 0, this.renderer.getMinMaxValues().maxSpeed)

document.getElementById("gcode-viewer").append(renderer.element())

renderer.render().then(() => console.log("rendering finished"))
```

### Resize
Just call `renderer.resize(width, height)` whenever the size changes.

### Slice the rendered model
To only show specific parts of the model you can use this:
* `renderer.sliceLayer(minLayer, maxLayer)` to slice based on the layer
* `renderer.slice(minPointNr, maxPointNr)` to slice based on the amount of points

For both see the documentation in the code/comments.

### Line resolution
To save some Memory and speedup the rendering a bit, you can reduce
the amount of planes per segment used:

```js
renderer.radialSegments = 3
```
The default is `8`.

### Travel lines
You can change the line width of travel lines:
```js
renderer.travelWidth = 0.1
```
The default is `0.01`. `0` is also possible to completely hide them.

### Skip / Filter lines
You can skip lines when parsing the gcode based on the gcode-line:
```
renderer.onAddLine = (newLine, lineNumber) => {
    if (lineNumber > 100 && lineNumber < 30000) {
        newLine.radius = 0
        return [newLine]
    }

    return [newLine]
}
```

The return type is an array to be able to also inject additional lines if needed. 
Also, as you can see in this example, you can alter the properties of the newLine.
In this case to just hide it, you can set the radius to 0.

You can use that for example to filter for specific line-types by parsing the line types out of 
the gcode in advance and then look them up in the onAddLine callback.
